## Project Direction – Are you starting fresh with a new concept or continuing an existing project? What led you to this decision?
    Again, I think that I will be continuing my art portfolio. Throughout the semester, I've revisited it for various other assignments, and 
    it would only make sense to visit it again for my final project.

## Theme and Goals – Briefly describe your project’s theme or main focus. What do you hope to achieve with the final version of your site. 
    The goal for my art portfolio is, and always has been, to advertise my art and services while also being user-friendly and visually appealing.

## Key Features – What specific features or design elements do you plan to incorporate (e.g., responsive design, interactive elements, a specific layout style)? What do you think will make this site stand out?
    Along with fixing glaring problems with my website, I will try to incorporate new elements- perhaps a function that "enhances" the images on the page upon clicking to easily isolate and take each individual one in (done!) I think this website will "stand out" in its own way by representing me as a person, my work, and my skill as a programmer and web designer!
