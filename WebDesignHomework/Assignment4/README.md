## How Web Browsers Function
Web browsers work by sending requests to web servers for web pages. They receive the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and then interpret and render these files into the visual representation of the web page you see. This involves using the HTML to construct the Document Object Model (DOM), applying CSS to style the content, and executing JavaScript to provide an interactive experience.

## What is the DOM (Document Object Model)?
The DOM is a tree-like structure that represents the content, structure, and style of a web page. It allows programming languages like JavaScript to interact with the document, enabling dynamic content updates, manipulation of elements, and responding to user events.

## HTML/XML/XHTML
- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: The standard markup language for creating web pages. It is flexible with syntax.
- **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**: Designed to store and transport data. It is strict with syntax.
- **XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language)**: A stricter, XML-based version of HTML. It combines the flexibility of HTML with the strict syntax rules of XML.

## The Four Essentials
1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Defines the document type and version of HTML.
2. `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.
3. `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document.
4. `<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document.

## What does index.html do, really?
The `index.html` page is the default landing page of a website and typically what the user will go to first without specifying which page they want to go to. You put it in the root directory.

## Top Naming Practices for Clean and Organized Code
1. Use descriptive names.
2. Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., camelCase, kebab-case).
3. Avoid words reserved by the programming language.
4. Keep names short but clear.
5. Use lowercase letters for filenames and directories.
6. Use hyphens or underscores to separate words in filenames.
