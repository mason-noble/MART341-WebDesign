<h1>Why I Chose These Ideas</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Website 1 (Portfolio)</h3>
    <p>The reason I'd like to design a portfolio site, first and foremost, is because I would like a place to store my art for future reference when I am searching for a career in digital art. Other portfolio websites are a little confusing to navigate, so maybe one site/page dedicated to my own stuff would be more helpful.</p>

<h3>Website 2 (Memes)</h3>
    <p>I don't really know. I'm just a silly guy. If I went with this idea, it'd be because I wanted a project that I wouldn't take too seriously and stress myself out over.</p>

<h3>Website 3 (Fake Business)</h3>
    <p>I think that fake businesses are so fun to make websites for! I enrolled in a program over the summer where we'd code and style a website for a fake company/client, and it was a blast. I'd like to do something like that again.</p>
