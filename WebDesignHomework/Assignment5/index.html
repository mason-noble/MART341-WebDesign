<h1>Assignment 5</h1>

<h3>Website 1</h3>
    <p>I'd like to make a portfolio website for my art. The tone will be casual, as I don't want to come off pretentious or overly-professional with my work. Maybe a green color scheme that's easy on the eyes like early DeviantArt? I just want to show off my art while being chill.</p><br/>

<h3>Website 2</h3>
    <p>Maybe I could make a joke website where I just dump a bunch of memes. The tone would be playful, it would probably have a really simple layout. Black text on a white background.</p><br/>

<h3>Website 3</h3>
    <p>A hypothetical business website advertising a fake service. I'd want this to be a mix of casual and professional. This would be amazing web design practice for if I decided to make it a career, but I could argue the same for Website 1. </p><br/>
