The website idea that I ultimately chose to pursue was my first- the art portfolio. Not only is is connected to something that I am really passionate about, but I've been meaning to create a little space to showcase my art without being flooded with unrelated content for a while now. I think that I'll go for a simple aesthetic that is easy on the eyes.

Reflection

Applying Balance Concepts

In this project, I applied several balance concepts to enhance the layout of my art portfolio website. By adjusting the background color to a light shade, the elements on the page stand out better, creating a clean and cohesive look. Setting a maximum width for the main content ensures that it does not overcrowd the page and remains centered, providing a harmonious visual experience.

Design Evolution

My final design turned out as expected, with a balanced and intuitive layout. Initially, I had a simpler design in mind, but incorporating white space and setting specific element widths helped achieve a more polished look. I experimented with margins and found that adding space around sections improved readability and overall aesthetics.

Challenges and Solutions

One challenge I faced was balancing the content and ensuring that images did not overwhelm the text. By setting a consistent width for the images and aligning them centrally, I managed to maintain a smooth visual flow. Additionally, ensuring proper spacing between sections helped avoid a cluttered appearance.

Overall, using CSS to manipulate background colors, widths, and margins significantly improved the balance and layout of my website. Through trial and error, I achieved a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
