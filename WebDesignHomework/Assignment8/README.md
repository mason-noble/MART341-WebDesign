Div - A div around my little image gallery, including a class indicating it as such, to make it more indicative in the code and easier to discern and style.

Span - Used span to highlight a certain word in my index- I wanted to emphasize what I was NOT willing to draw.

Class - "gallery" - So I can style my gallery of images into a proper grid instead of relying on using break every 2 images.
        "button" - To style my links/hrefs connecting the pages of my site as a button and make it look more aesthetically pleasing.
        "highlight" - highlights a word/set of words.
