# Mason Noble - Assignment 3

### _Thoughts about this week's topic._

I did not think that I would learn more about **The Internet** than I already know. But I did, and I am fascinated! Here are some of the facts that I never knew or even considered...

- The internet was originally made to send intelligence back and forth.
- Web design is a factor of web development, but web development isn't necessarily web design: in the same sense that a square is a rectangle, but a rectangle is not a square.
- I actually did not know the terminology for "https://" was a _protocol_, the same with "www" being a _subdomain_.

Here is a link to the accessibility checker I showed off in this week's discussion board: [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools](https://wave.webaim.org/)

And lastly, an unrelated image, drawn by me.
