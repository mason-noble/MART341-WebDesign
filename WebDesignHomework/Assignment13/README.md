## Required Techniques (Must Have):

At Least 4 Pages – Your website should contain a minimum of four distinct pages that align with a cohesive theme.

Responsive Design – Ensure the website layout adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

Media Queries – Use CSS media queries to make design adjustments at specific screen widths for optimal user experience on all devices.

Navigation Menu – Include a clear, user-friendly navigation menu to allow visitors to easily access each page of the site.

Dropdown Menu – Add a dropdown menu within the navigation for sub-pages or sections, if applicable.

## Note:

I just made a bare bones website, no fancy styling or images (I kind of just recycled stuff from my older projects). I'm just focusing on ensuring that all of the criteria for this assignment have been met.
